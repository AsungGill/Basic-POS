Basic Point Of Sales system, created in Visual Basic 6 IDE
I fully commented the source code so anyone can modify and improve if needed

Some of the implemented technique in this project application are :

1.) Embedding executable files inside a Visual Basic Forms.
     - Implemented in the splash form
     -	Also in the About form.
	 
2.) Using PNG for images for butttons, product images and general user interface design, this made Visual Basic 6 Application look like an application created in modern IDE.
     - This is implemented using an extra controls with an OCX file named LaVolpeAlphaImg2.ocx.
	 - To test the application, make sure to register the ocx file.
	 
3.) Using text file as a flat file database for the application

4.) Using Windows API to retrieve the name of the currently logged in user that was used in the login forms. 

NOTES : 

   - Although you can modify the code in a simple text editor, the code is developed in Visual Basic 6 IDE so it is also advisable that you edit and modify this code in VB6 editor.
   
   - The code will reference the OCX file and 2 executable files I used in the splash screen and about form, to get this file so that you can test the code from VB6 IDE, go to http://danreb.com/freebies and download the zip file for this application. Alternatively you can download the package installer( example application ) there.
   
   - The LoVelpeAlphaImg2.ocx was responsible for Alpha Image transparency and PNG images support in VB 6 forms.

What is included in this repository?

    README             - this file
	PointofSale.vbp    - the main file, open this in VB6 IDE
	frmSplash.frm      - the splash form
	frmLogin.frm       - the login form
	frmMain.frm        - the Main POS form
	frmCheckout.frm    - the checkout form

Because I used images JPG/PNG in the projects, VB6 IDE generate several .frx file for each form, so this is needed for cosmetic or user interface purpose of the app.

   frmSplash.frx       - for the splash form
   frmLogin.frx        - for the login form
   frmMain.frx         - for the Main form
   frmCheckout.frx     - for Checkout form
